# NACCisTooBig
NACC is the data collected annually on 27,000 of participants in a National Institute of Health study on Alzheimer's Disease. The file made available for my research project had about 9 years of data and was 289MB.

I was working on an AI modeling problem and sought to use the NACC data to train the model. Training took forever and I knew I had to shrink the data. This was written to reduce the size of the data so the treining time would come down but the performance of the trained model would not.   

Returns only the most recent record for each participant of the study.
